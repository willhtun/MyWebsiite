        <p> My name is Wai Yan Htun [Will] and I am from Los Angeles, California. I am a 4th year
            undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at University of 
            California, Los Angeles. </p>
        <p> I am currently working as a front-end web developer for a student startup at UCLA. We are
            building an online shopping platform tailored for college students, and plan to launch in
            2019. For my side projects, I have worked on Android apps, web apps, and video games in
            Unity3D Engine. </p>
        <p> I have always had an immense interest in art and technology. My passion is to create
            softwares and applications that allow me to combine my artistic creativity with my problem 
            solving skills. I am interested in developing softwares and applications that
            aim to bridge the gap even closer between humans and technology, while at the same time
            ensuring ease of use, intuition, privacy and safety. </p>
        <p> In my free time, I like to watch movies, take photographs, create digital art and play videogames. </p>
        <br/>
        <p> I am currently seeking an internship opportunity for Summer 2019.</p>
